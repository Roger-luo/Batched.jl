# Batched.jl

BatchedArrays in Julia.

**This package is not functional for now, please use the [BatchedRoutines.jl](https://github.com/Roger-luo/BatchedRoutines.jl) for now.

**Warning**: this is still under its early stage, use at your own risk.

## Batched Arrays

`BatchedArray` is like an `Array` of `Array`s, but with contiguous storage in memory, so we could do some optimization based on that.

```julia
julia> A = BatchedArray(rand(2, 3, 10));

julia> B = BatchedArray(rand(3, 2, 10));

julia> eltype(A)
Element{Float64,2,P} where P
```

And with Julia's broadcast, this will just work:

```julia
julia> A .* B
10-element BatchedArray{Float64,2,1,Array{Float64,3}}:
 [0.947403 1.40625; 0.869711 0.848727]
